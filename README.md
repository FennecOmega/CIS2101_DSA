NOTES FOR USAGE:

Simply type in any integer that is not listed as a choice between 1-4 to terminate the program.

The program automatically displays the results, if you want to improve formatting you may just
edit the code.

If anyone wants me to add code in order to have interaction with the ADTs, just ask and I'll add
a separate folder with those implementations.



NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATIONS:

You may use any of the implementations freely for Stacks, Queues, and Hashing.
Just uncomment the implementations that are not being used.

HOWEVER

Cursorlist has no native BitVector support, please include the ComputerWordImplementation.h
File alongside CursorImplementation.h so you will not run into errors.

ALSO when including ComputerWordImplementation.h, please comment out the line that says
'#include ".\TestFiles\BitVectorTest.h"' as the ComputerWordImplementation.h file has its own
version of the BitVectorTest in order to be compatible with a scalar char type.



NOTES ON MODIFICATIONS:

For ComputerWordImplementation I have added datatypes that allow 64 bits like int and long long int. Uncomment the implementation you want, and make changes to BitVectorTest function to use
BV_32 (32 bit) and BV_64 (64 bit) respectively for insertion into universal set.



Thank you :D
