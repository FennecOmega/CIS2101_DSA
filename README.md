# TEMPORARY TO-DO LIST

- Create arraylist implementations 1-4
- Create hashing
- Create files for practice code
- Create testing files that parse outputs and compare it with functioning code outputs
- Reorganize files.

# USAGE

You may use any of the implementations freely for Stacks, Queues, and Hashing.
Just uncomment the implementations that are not being used.

Cursorlist has no native BitVector support, please include the ComputerWordImplementation.h
File alongside CursorImplementation.h so you will not run into errors.

ALSO when including ComputerWordImplementation.h, please comment out the line that says
'#include ".\TestFiles\BitVectorTest.h"' as the ComputerWordImplementation.h file has its own
version of the BitVectorTest in order to be compatible with a scalar char type.
